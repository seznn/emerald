							<p>Hello dear awesome stranger ever,</p> 
							<p>Sezin Engür is a mathematical engineer, MA degree candidate in game design at 
							<a href="http://www.bahcesehir.edu.tr/">Bahcesehir University</a> and interested in entrepreneurship
								with a penchant for the ideas, games, and machine learning. She prefers to refer to herself in the first person.</p>

						<p>I’m currently living in Istanbul, working on final touches of my killer thesis. I have just learned some Swift and XCode
							for my lovely unicorn sized app ideas for the world of Apple. Few months ago, I was living in Berlin and
							
							 coding in Python to automate boring tasks for my lovely colleagues 
							at <a href="https://www.5meter.de">5meter</a>. In addition, attend meetups are about ML, Data Science, Python,
							enjoy brand new(not always but its OK:)) info with Club Mate (not always cold :/) and ,top of top, 
							talking, meeting, networking, interacting with people who are alive library for me.
						I had worked at <a href="http://www.netmarbleturkey.com/tr/">
							Netmarble</a> as a QA Analyst for more than a year and then went Cologne to join Erasmus Exchange Programme.</p>

						
							<p>I am a self-taught python programmer started on Codecademy then had solved 
							some algorithm problems, built some web based projects via MOOCs.Then, jumped into iOS, 
							did same for Swift language,but instead of solving algorithm problems, decided to learn creating own apps, 
							launching them on Product Hunt, reading crashlytics on Firebase, using GCP (Google Cloud Platform) wisely :) 
							
							</p>
							
							<p>I spend my time 
							learning (<a href="https://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>,<a href="https://www.coursera.org/"> Coursera
							</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/">EdX</a>), meditating with an app(<a href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</a>)
							checking Quora, Stack Overflow, Medium, reading  
							(Mostly self development and biography.)  
							,playing/learning guitar with Rocksmith, and doing sport (I 've just learned how to play American flag football at Bahcesehir University.) . Of course I love games,especially 
							PC games(Assassin's Creed series and Stanley's Parable are my favorite ones). 
							I am trying to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro technique</a> :) </p> 
							
						
				
						
						<p>You can also take a look at my
